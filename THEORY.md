**Question 1: Complex Animation Implementation**

To create smooth and complex scroll-triggered animation, I would break the animation into smaller and reusable components and trigger them only when needed. This modular approach ensures better maintainability and scalability. To keep performance high, I would focus on animating properties like transform and opacity, which are GPU accelerated, and avoid animations that cause layout recalculation, like width and height.

For profiling, I would use browser developer tools to monitor frame rates, dropped frames, and animated paint times. Tools like Lighthouse would help analyze overall page performance. Based on the findings, I would test them on multiple devices to ensure smooth performance and identify potential bottlenecks in real-world scenarios.

**Question 2: Handling Traffic Spikes**

I would start by monitoring the system using different tools to identify performance bottlenecks and areas that require optimization. Adding caching with Redis for frequently accessed data would help reduce database load immediately and ensure faster response times. Additionally, implementing load balancing would further enhance the systemâ€™s scalability.

I would implement a containerized setup with Docker and Kubernetes to allow automatic scaling based on traffic. This ensures efficient resource usage during high demand. I would also optimize the APIs for better load distribution with fewer DB queries and handling errors to minimize downtime during traffic spikes.

**Question 3: AI Tools Integration**

When using AI tools, I would rely on them for exploring patterns and saving time, but I would carefully review and test their outputs to avoid errors. This is critical to ensuring that AI-generated results align with business requirements and expectations. In complex scenarios, human oversight would remain a key factor.

I would use AI to write test cases to catch issues early, ensuring a robust quality assurance process. For both APIs and React components, I would leverage React Testing Library and Jest to test components effectively and ensure that the AI-generated code works seamlessly in the application.

**Question 4: Legacy Application Modernization**

The first phase would involve adding logging and monitoring in each section to understand the application's behavior. This would help gather insights into any areas needing improvement. Critical paths would be identified through user analytics and error rates, ensuring that we focus on the most impactful areas first.

Success metrics would include reduced error rates, improved response times, and decreased deployment failures. These KPIs would ensure that the modernization process meets business goals. Regular team meetings and clear documentation would keep everyone aligned with the modernization goals and promote efficient collaboration throughout the project.
